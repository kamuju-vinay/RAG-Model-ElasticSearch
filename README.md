# RAG-Model-ElasticSearch
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model by integrating Cohereâ€™s LLM with ElasticSearch for a powerful Q&amp;A system. It uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping to retrieve documents, which the LLM processes to generate detailed responses, ensuring fast, accurate, and relevant results through seamless search and generation.
